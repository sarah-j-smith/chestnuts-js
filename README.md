# Javascript / Typescript Puzzler

This repository contains practice examples I did in Nov 2023 to 
improve my understanding of plain vanilla single page apps.

There are three versions of solutions to the same problem:

_Evaluate a mathematical expression given as a string_

Each solution is successively more terse and smaller in footprint, but
possibly harder to understand. 

# Sample problems

    '7 * 5 * 3 - 2 * 8 - 7 ^ 2'

    '5 * 4 - 2'

    ''

    '0'

    '5'

# Solution 1

* [Tree in Typescript](solution_1/README.md)

# Solution 2

* [Tree in Javascript](solution_2/README.md)

# Solution 3

* [Tabulation in Javascript](solution_3/README.md)
